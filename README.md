Code up these three programs and submit your source code (*.java) to your GitHub Classroom remote repo.

1) ReversedStrings.java - You will create a simple program that takes a user's input string and reverses it. For example, if the user inputs "hello", the program will output "olleh".

2) MaddnessWithMethods.java -  You will explore the use of functions in Java. You will create a program that involves three distinct functions: getAnIntFromTheUser, compareTwoInts, and sumTwoInts. The program will demonstrate how functions can be used to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.

3) LargestOfThree.java - This program, titled "LargestOfThree.java" is designed to help you understand conditional statements in Java. Your task is to write a program that asks the user for three integers, determines the largest among them using nested if statements, and outputs the largest integer.
